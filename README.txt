Solo Project: Tyler Truman

Name: Booger Beater, the Finale. Raid on Booger Keep

Setting: Space Station or in Space, haven't decided

Lore: A war that has been fought since the beginning of time is seemingly coming to its end. You play the protagonist, who's lineage has been at constant war with the boogers. He plans to end the war once and for all by killing the hive mind that controls the booger people.

May try to incorporate a boss fight that is similar to the boss fight in Destiny 2's prophecy dungeon, when fighting the Kell Echo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRYz4P1Wlto at timestamp 2:50 is the beginning of the fight

List of features: Menu, with all required buttons Win condition: beating the final boss Lose condition: running out of health Pause Menu, which would allow the user to quit the game Instructions listed somewhere like the main menu Sound effects possibly for enemy death, and definitely for shooting. Looping background track as well. UI with my health, and maybe something like ammo count or kill count

May use some landscape like large rocks, etc. Or some space station lighting, haven't decided yet. Inventory Screen is planned as of now.
